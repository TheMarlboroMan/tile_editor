This tool depends on libdansdl2:
	https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/libdansdl2

For its input, it needs sprite sheets generated by this other tool:
	https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/tabla_sprites

Example configuration files are provided in the ejemplo_config directory.

As of November 5th, 2015, the tool has been patched with a compatibility layer to support the many changes made to the original libdansdl2. Should the tool be updated, the compatibility layer will be removed. The tool now needs the SDL2_ttf library to link with (even though it's not used).

Here follows a translation of the output of the tool, when used without parameters:

Use: executable res=WxH out=output_file cfg=config_file
	./a.out res=800x600 out=out.dat cfg=config.dat

PAR√ÅMETERS:
	res: Screen resolution expressed as width x height.
	out: Name of the output file. If the file exists, the map will be loaded.
	cfg: Name of the configuration file, made up of N lines with this format:

		T	sprite_sheet_name	comment_character	|	path_to_graphics	alpha	r_value_for_alpha	g_value_for_alpha	b_value_for_alpha
		O	path_to_object_definition

	The first T or O characters determine if the line defines a set of tiles or a set of objects. All sets specified will be loaded.

	Sprite sheets are generated with the "editor_sprites" tool.

	Object format is:
		id	name	width	height	default_color
			property_name	default_color
			property_name	default_color
			property_name	default_color
		id	name	width	height	default_color
			property_name	default_color
		[...]
