Setup was succesful!.

Before compiling you must have built all previous dependencies as stated in the original project's README.md file.

Once the dependencies are ready you will be able to compile and try the project with make -f makefile_linux|win all. The flags of the compiler will be set to enable debugging.

If you haven't do so yet, please, build the libdansdl2, dfw, log and tools documentation with doxygen!.

If you want to, you cd into scripts and do "./create_controller controller_name" to automatically create a controller and add it to the dependency list. This will also add the controller to the states.h file and the state_driver.* files through the magic of sed. If no initial controller was setup, this script will set it.

You can many wonderful examples and information in the original project.

To build the project, head to the build directory and execute "make". Remember that the project won't be functional until a starting controller is set!.

Happy hacking :).
